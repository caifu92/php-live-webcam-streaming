## Installation Instructions for PHP Live Video Streaming Software
 * Before installing, make sure your hosting environment meets all [requirements](https://videowhisper.com/?p=Requirements) (including a supported RTMP server). 
 * For enabling transcoding for HTML5 HLS / MPEG DASH playback required for iOS/Android delivery, special requirements apply: latest Wowza and FFMPEG with Flash and HTML5 specific codecs.

 1. If you're not hosting RTMP with VideoWhisper (see requirements and turnkey hosting options) go to [RTMP Application Setup](https://videowhisper.com/?p=RTMP+Applications) for installation details
 2. Deploy files to your web installation location. (Example: yoursite.domain/php-live-streaming-webcam/)
 3. Fill your RTMP path into settings.php
 4. If you don't have SuPHP, enable write permissions (0777) for folders: snapshots, uploads
 5. To enable transcoding for HTML5 playback, configure HLS / MPEG DASH as per Wowza specs and fill httpstreamer & httpdash setting in settings.php . 
If you have Wowza hosting with us, our staff can assist with setting this up (our plans come with a rtmp address preconfigured for such usage).
